# Glossary
Basically, all xCP entities are defined close to the real-world objects they represent. 


## Application
When a PPP is (or PPPs are) applied to a certain crop at a certain field we call this an *Application*. Typically, a farmer puts a PPP (or a set of PPPs) into a spraying tank, fills the tank up with water, drives to the field and sprays the solution onto the field (into the crop). Here, the term *Application* and is related to its operation use in pesticide risk assessment, especially the exposure modelling part.  
 Thus, an application is defined by 
 - a PPP (or PPPs) 
 - an application rate
 - an application time window
 - an application technology
 - risk mitigation measures, eg, spray buffer, drift-reducing nozzles


Remark and outlook:  
 
 - crop stage to replace application time window
