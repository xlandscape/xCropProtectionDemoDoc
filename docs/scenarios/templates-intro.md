# Intro
The *Templates* section provides examples for xCP [**Parameterisations**](../reference/glossary.md#parameterisation). *Parameterisation* refers to the actual xCP parameterisation, ie. building PPP use scenarios.  The templates are for learning purposes and can be used as building block for your own parameterisation.   

Note: the parameterisation makes use of XML as a necessary and sufficient representation of the natural complexity of the characteristics of real-world PPP applications in cultivated landscapes. We are fully aware that XML is not the ideal **user interface**. The development of a **graphical user interface (GUI)** is planned.
