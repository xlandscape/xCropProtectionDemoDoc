## Application information

Location of PPM Calendars: *CropProtection\PPMCalendars\Rummen-xCP-TestingScenario*

This scenario may be used along with its PPM Calendars to gain familiarity with the structure and output of xCropProtection. The two PPM Calendars located in the *Rummen-xCP-TestingScenario* folder contain simple applications with sample products. This scenario may also be used in the development of new PPM Calendars because of the relatively small number of fields.
