# xLandscape
In one sentence, xLandscape is a **modular framework** that allow **to build models** that simulate processes (phenomenons) in real-world landscapes.  
xLandscape is not a model, but a framework to build models. This is done by composing [*components*](#modules-and-components) and to a model. This landscape model xxx integrated xxx inner consistancy

The '*x*' represent the explicit paradigm of xLandscape framework.

The corrent major version level is *1.x* which essentially means that we have a working software available which implements the key design and  essential requirements, however, which has known limitation with respect to where we want to go to (see [Vision](#vision) below):
  
See the xLandscape core's [README](https://github.com/xlandscape/LandscapeModel-Core/blob/master/README.md) at GitHub for detailed instructions at technical level.


## Vision

Imagine, 
- modular system available which you can make use of and add your modules
- Integrated Development Environment

## History
Early 
early work on landscape-level risk assessment had a focus on making exposure modelling more realistic.  our key critics on approaches at that time (mid 2000s) was about the sampling methods xxx generated non-realistic conditions, hence, distributions of exposure and so risk assessment.  pattern, units, scales where missing  
tested working within GIS, close to big-data spatial databases (eg rasdaman), Almass, OpenMI, xxx and a range of related approaches which all ended up in dead ends for the purposes and needs of our work in environmental risk assessment, risk management and more generic related fields.

Characteristics

- 
- numeric, Monte Carlo
- multidimensional, 
- Python

### Modules and Components 

You will read the term ***component*** quite often in the context of *xLandscape* and so *xCP*.  = Mo-Based Software



### Multidimensional Data Store

currently, [HDF](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md#multidimensional-data-store) is being used.
